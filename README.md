# SurferList

SurferList is a website application written in PHP and JavaScript that lets users post listings of items to an online catalog to share information, start discussions, and offer items for sale.

## Features

[Features](https://www.surferslist.com/features) from popular sites like [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/) (e.g. classified ads, multiple locations, anonymity), [eBay](https://www.craigslist.org/) (e.g. e-commerce, peer-to-peer, business registration), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) (e.g. user profiles, topic discussion, social sharing) were combined into a central platform.

## Usage

SurfersList was created to help enthusiasts of the surfing and other extreme watersports community connect online to discuss and sell sports equipment.  But the code that runs it could be reconfigured for use by any other market or group.

Users can search and browse the catalog by category, brand/manufacturer, or user profile.  Results can be filtered by location, listing type, price/value, condition, and age.  Additional data fields and filters could be added.

## Listing Types

Listings can be posted anonymously or linked to a user profile.  Anonymous listings can be posted by anyone.  They must include a link (url) to a web page where other users can learn more about the item.  Anonymous listings can not be offered for sale, but they are useful for learning and discussion.  Users who create an account and a profile can post their own items and even offer them for sale. See [Listing Types](https://www.surferslist.com/about-listings#listing-types) for more info.

## History

This project began as a multi-seller/multi-vendor extension for [OpenCart](https://github.com/opencart/opencart) (an e-commerce CMS) back in 2013.  As it grew in complexity, rather than continuing to update it to work with newer versions of the CMS, in 2015 work was started to integrate it more deeply into a forked copy of version 1.5 of the software ([OpenCart-CE](https://github.com/opencart-ce/opencart-ce), to be precise).  Since then, much of the code has been *substantially* updated, extended, improved, and refactored.

## Under the Hood

[SurfersList.com](https://www.surferslist.com/) is running on Ubuntu with Apache and MySQL (LAMP stack) on a VM hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  It requires a minimum PHP version of 5.4.
